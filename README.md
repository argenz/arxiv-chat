Familiarize yourself with arXiv’s API Terms of Use.
Review the API Basics and the API User Manual.
Acknowledge arXiv data usage with this statement on your product: “Thank you to arXiv for use of its open access interoperability.”
Do not brand your project with arXiv’s names (“arXiv”, “arXiv.org”, “arXiv Labs”, “arXivLabs”) or use associated logos, web addresses, and colors in a manner that implies arXiv’s endorsement of the project.
Check out the arXiv API user community to learn, ask questions, and share information about your project.
Review these additional resources about arXiv’s interoperability: arXiv’s identifier scheme, bulk data access information, and the Open Archives Initiative.
